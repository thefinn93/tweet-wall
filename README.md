A fork of a fork of a fork of a cool project. This is my take on it.
Scrolls tweets from the top global twitter trend and pictures on the
side. The pictures are sourced from flickr and twitter, the tweets are
sourced from twitter (identica might come, feel free to submit a pull
request). If the top global trend isn't cool enough for you, you can
give it the request paramenter `?q=` followed by your query. `?query=`
is also acceptable. A live copy of this can be found
[on my site](https://www.thefinn93.com/tweet-wall).
